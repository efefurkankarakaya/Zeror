# What does Zeror work?
Zeror writes over all files 0 byte in destination for providing permanently and unrecoverable erasure and then removes files.

# Why is Zeror written?
It was my test program for data erasure because of deletion is never make datum completely erased on storage drives. Almost every data is standing their own addresses till the storage drive get harmed or the file is overwritten.

# What does overwrite mean here?
It means new data is writing over the old data's which is deleted from system address.

# What is delete, erase and wipe?
* Delete: Makes the data hidden. The data is still there and still have same address in storage drive.
* Erase: Deletes and then overwrites the data / datum.
* Wipe: Erases all data.

# How to use?
* Write a path to destination variable.
* Run zeror.py
