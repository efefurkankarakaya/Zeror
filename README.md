# What does it work?
Zeror writes over all files 0 byte in destination for providing permanently and unrecoverable erasure.

# Why is it written?
It was my test program for data erasure because of deletion is never make datum completely erased on storage drives. Almost every data is standing their own addresses till the storage drive get harmed or the file is overwritten.

# What does overwrite mean here?
It means new data is writing over the old data's (deleted from system) address.

# What is delete, erase and wipe?
* Delete: Makes the data hidden. The data is still there and still have same address in storage drive.
* Erase: Deletes and then overwrites the data / datum.
* Wipe: Erases all data.

# How to use?
* Write a path to destination variable.
* Run terminal and go to same directory.
* Write python3 main.py (or python main.py) on terminal.
